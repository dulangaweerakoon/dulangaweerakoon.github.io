I am fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science, advised by Prof. Archan Misra and co-advised by Dr. Vigneshwaran Subbaraju, at School of Computing and Information Systems of Singapore Management University (SMU). Currently, I am working as a PhD Research Intern at IHPC, A*STAR Singapore. 

My current research interests primarily includes, Multi-modal sensing for Human-AI Collaboration on pervasive devices with low energy, latency and computational requirements. Primarily, I am currently working on developing human instruction comprehension algorithms, which can accept vision, language and human gestures as input modalities. My work has proposed various fusing techniques and optimization strategies to utilize these modalities to either improve instruction comprehension accuracy or reduce latency and energy overheads while achieving comparable accuracy even on resource-constrained pervasive devices.

Prior to my PhD studies, I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Then, I worked at Singapore Management University as a Research Engineer, advised by Prof. Archan Misra for a year.
