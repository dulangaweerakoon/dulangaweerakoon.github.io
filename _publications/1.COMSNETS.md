We present a multi-modal human instruction comprehension prototype for object acquisition tasks that involve
verbal, visual and pointing gesture cues. Our prototype includes
an AR smart-glass for issuing the instructions and a Jetson TX2
pervasive device for executing comprehension algorithms. With
this setup, we enable on-device, computationally efficient object
acquisition task comprehension with an average latency in the
range of 150-330msec.
